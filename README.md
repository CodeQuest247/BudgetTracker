# BudgetTracker
This C++ program allows users to input multiple people's monthly income and expenses, storing each person's data in a binary file. It calculates net income by subtracting rent, food, utilities, and miscellaneous costs from income, then reads the data back to generate a formatted text report with clear headers for all entries.
